# Full Stack JavaScript Product Feedback App - Frontend Mentor

This project comes from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-feedback-app-wbvUYqjR6) site. The goal is to create a site that manages user comments. So I decided to code this project myself using JavaScript for the front end and NodeJS for the back end.
